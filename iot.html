      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>The Internet of Things (IoT) is transforming how humans and machines interact. It encompasses a growing network of physical objects embedded with sensors, actuators, and software that collect and exchange data over the internet. IoT allows devices to communicate with each other, leading to greater automation, insight, and efficiency in every sector of life.</p>
      <p>From smart thermostats in homes to predictive maintenance sensors in factories, IoT is reshaping industries and redefining daily experiences.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="iot-section">
      <h2>Origins and Evolution</h2>
      <p>Though the term "Internet of Things" was coined in 1999 by Kevin Ashton, the idea of connected devices dates back even further. The evolution of internet connectivity, miniaturization of electronics, and rapid development of wireless technologies have enabled the proliferation of IoT.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>2008-2009:</strong> The number of connected devices surpassed the human population.</li>
        <li><strong>2014:</strong> IoT becomes a buzzword with commercial smart devices entering homes and workplaces.</li>
        <li><strong>2020s:</strong> Billions of devices operate in every domain from agriculture to aerospace.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="iot-section">
      <h2>Applications Across Sectors</h2>
      <article>
        <h3>Smart Homes</h3>
        <p>IoT enables lighting, heating, and appliances to be controlled remotely. Devices like smart speakers, thermostats, doorbells, and even refrigerators improve comfort and convenience while optimizing energy consumption.</p>
      </article>
      <article>
        <h3>Healthcare</h3>
        <p>IoT-based devices such as heart monitors, glucose sensors, and fitness trackers provide continuous health monitoring and real-time data sharing with healthcare providers, revolutionizing patient care and emergency response.</p>
      </article>
      <article>
        <h3>Agriculture</h3>
        <p>Farmers use IoT sensors for soil moisture, climate conditions, and livestock tracking. Smart irrigation systems help conserve water while improving crop yields.</p>
      </article>
      <article>
        <h3>Transportation & Logistics</h3>
        <p>Connected vehicles and GPS-tracked fleets ensure efficient deliveries, reduce fuel consumption, and improve safety. IoT also powers traffic lights, toll systems, and public transport schedules.</p>
      </article>
      <article>
        <h3>Industrial Automation</h3>
        <p>In factories, sensors monitor machinery health, predict failures, and trigger maintenance alerts automatically, reducing downtime and increasing productivity.</p>
      </article>
    </section>

    <section class="iot-section">
      <h2>IoT Architecture</h2>
      <p>The typical IoT system consists of several layers:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Perception Layer:</strong> Physical sensors and actuators gather data.</li>
        <li><strong>Network Layer:</strong> Data is transmitted via Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, ZigBee, or 5G.</li>
        <li><strong>Processing Layer:</strong> Edge or cloud computing platforms analyze the data.</li>
        <li><strong>Application Layer:</strong> User interfaces visualize insights and allow control.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="iot-challenges">
      <h2>Security, Privacy, and Interoperability</h2>
      <p>While IoT offers countless benefits, it also presents unique challenges:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Security:</strong> Many devices have weak security protocols. Without regular updates, they are vulnerable to hacking, botnets, and data breaches.</li>
        <li><strong>Privacy:</strong> Continuous data collection raises ethical concerns. Clear consent and data governance policies are crucial.</li>
        <li><strong>Interoperability:</strong> Lack of universal standards hinders device communication. Open-source platforms and partnerships are helping bridge gaps.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="future">
      <h2>Future Outlook</h2>
      <p>The future of IoT is incredibly promising. With advances in AI and machine learning, IoT devices will become smarter and more autonomous. Edge computing will reduce latency and enable faster decision-making. Urban development will be driven by real-time data, creating responsive cities. In agriculture, drones and smart tractors will handle tasks automatically, while in healthcare, implantable IoT devices may monitor internal organs.</p>
      <p>By 2030, it's expected that there will be over 25 billion connected devices globally. IoT will not just connect things, but also enable entirely new business models and societal structures.</p>
